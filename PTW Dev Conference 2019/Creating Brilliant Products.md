How AI is unique?
 - The product doesn't really have an "interface", most work is behind the scenes
 - How do you measure accuracy?
 - The virtuous circle of AI, product -> users -> data
 - Need to get things out there early vs having it be perfect
 - Lots of experimentation - "This may not work and that's okay"
 	- Low risk/high risk portfolio

Resistance to getting less risky things put out there
 - Have safe places to put things that are under construction to just start getting data

 - Advancing women who are already there
  - paying a little extra attention to those who don't look like the rest

 - Work/life balance, maternity leave policies, etc
