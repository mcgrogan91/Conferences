Opportunities to build a career, not just a job

2 paths: (Me vs we)
 - mercenary path
 	- money
 	-

 - missionary path
 	- mission
 	- 


Want someone that's going to be collaborative
When you jump right to a solution and skip learning about the problem, that's a problem

Mission-based Culture (Company: Power)
 - Nitro platform
 - Mission was to build a platform to do... stuff related to home ownership?

Considerations:
 - Beyond the money
 - Do you believe what you are going to be doing is important?
  - To you
  - To company
 - Will the job allow you to be valued & appreciated?
 - Will you be able to show up everyday with passion & purpose?
 - Do you understand the mission you are signing up for?

Mission can change if you sell the company
 - Mission chanes to profit, mercenary work

You'll make more money, create more value, live more fulfilled lives, have a brighter future if you stay the course on a mission

How to identify a mission driven organization?
	1. What's the average tenure of people?
		- Longer tenures can hint at missions
	2. Contractor vs full time employees?
		- What's the mix?
		- How are they treated? (PTO, etc?)
	3. Insights into the company culture
		- Shadow the business, ask if they'll host you for a day
	4. Does the company or department work in teams?
		- Teams to mentor, build people up
	5. Will I get to build things?
		- Are you building something, or are you wiring up things/maintenance?
	6. Are there opportunities to get feedback from the end-user?
		- Do you get to talk to them?
	7. Does the company have a mission-based culture?
	8. What kind of impact will I be able to have?
	9. What will my mission be?
		- What is it within the group?

18-24 months: The value they hired you for
