# Kyle McGrogan Conference Attendance

I go to conferences sometimes, and I try to take notes on the talks I see.

This leads to a want to make this information public (Unless otherwise stated by the speaker).

Inside are the various conferences I have been to, and the notes I have taken.


## Legacy

The notes from the Laracon folder are from Laracon US 2016 in Louisville, KY.  They exist as their own repo at [this address](https://github.com/mcgrogan91/Laracon), but have been moved into here as this repo is more relevant to the future.
