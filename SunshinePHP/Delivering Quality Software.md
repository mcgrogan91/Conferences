## What is quality software?

* Does it solve your customer's problem?
* Does it do so sustainably?
 * Are you able to maintain it?
 * Can you add features as the customer's needs change and grow?
 * Can you do so securely?

Look up: ISO/IEC 25010:2011 Software Quality Model

If you have someone focused on the following areas, you'll have quality software. One person can maybe cover 2 well at a time

### Coding

* Syntax and coding standards
* Understanding Avainable Tools (language/IDE/etc)
* Unit testing
* CI/CD

### Architecture

* Architecture
* Coupling of components
* Messaging

### Process

There are people, process, and political problems.  Technical problems aren't a thing anymore.

* Agile Ceremony
* Retrospectives
* Backlog
* Code Quality

### Customers

Do you have somebody focused on your customers?

Customer (Who is paying) vs Users (Who actually uses the software)

* Backlog grooming
* User stories
* Surveys

### Technical Strategy

What is the strategy across all of your applications?

* Product suites
* Support systems
* Distribution strategy

### Business Strategy

What's your strategy for generating income?

Microsoft created the Enterprise Agreement - you don't own the software, you're leasing it. Renewable income

Cloud shifted the lease time from years to seconds/hours

* Sales process
* Finance

## Culture

### Operate as a software company

* Instead of being an X company that has software, be a software company funded by X
* Business Strategy and Technical strategy need to be in alignment

### Celebrating Outcomes

* Celebrate when your customers tell you it's good, not when you release
* When a project is shelved because business strategy shifted. (If you're on the technical side)
 * You still did good work
 * If you're on the business side, learn from it.  What happened to cause the shift, lead to lost effort?
* When mistakes occur, they are opportunities to learn and change
 * Lost income from mistakes is an expensive way to train an employee

### Operate on trust

Trust is incredibly important for working together as a team, as a company

Company needs to trust (and verify at times) that you're going to get work done and deliver

Read about Satya Nadella's changes at Microsoft that helped him engender trust there

### Focus on quality

Quality is the anchor of everything you do. Quality/time/features triangle, don't sacrifice on quality.

### Focus on Learning

Whole lot about this in every talk.  Pretty self explanitory.

Don't write to master when you're excited with changes from a conference

### Have a strong mission statement

Being inspired by your mission statement can drive you, and inform decisions. How does your team add to that vision?

### Diversity of thought

Pressure cooks ideas until they are great.  Homogenous groups won't create great ideas that serve the needs of diverse customer groups.

Are you inviting diverse voices? Are you _listening_ to diverse voices?
