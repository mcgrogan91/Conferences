# SunshinePHP 2020 - Friday

The first day of SunshinePHP, below are the talks I currently anticipate going to:

## Opening Keynote - Think Like a Programmer

Talk by: Cal Evans

Description: If anybody can write code, what separates programmers from those that just write code? Programmers think differently. Coders have to learn to think differently if they want to make the jump to programmers. In this talk we will look at 6 concepts that programmers need to master. Concepts that will help them think like a programmer.

## Integrated Feature Management - Using Feature Flags

Talk by: Dana Luther

Description: A/B testing? Canary Rollouts? Service maintenance windows? All of these and more can be controlled dynamically by using feature flags. In this presentation, we'll go over the benefits of feature flags and demonstrate how to effectively incorporate them into your codebase and workflows. You don't need a fancy service to make this happen - there are several php libraries you can use. In this scenario, I will demonstrate the Swivel library using a MySQL database.

## PHP and a Serverless Future

Talk by: Doug Steinberg

Description: One of the hottest buzz words in programming today is "Serverless". But what does that mean? How can you host a PHP app without a server? Serverless can mean different things. I'm going to explain what it means to a PHP developer and why you might want to try it out. - Serverless means not having to maintain or manage a server - Serverless means not paying for computing power you don't use - Serveless means effortless scaling and speed - Serverless means easy fast deployments In this talk I'll show you some serverless options and example applications and the tremendous advantage deploying them to a serverless infrastructure can give you.


## General Session - The Reign Of Quantity, or Why Reinvention Is Not Always Better

Talk by: Matthew Weier O'Phinney

Description: Programming is a wonderful profession for problem solvers, and a random sampling of developers will generally have different ways of solving the exact same problem. This can be great in teams, as it allows finding solutions that resolve the unstated issues: performance, flexibility, and maintainability being some of the more frequent. But programmers tend to also have egos, and think their way is the correct way, disregarding one or more facets of a problem, and this is when we have conflict within our profession. How can we resolve those conflicts? And when does quantity of code give way to quality of code â€” and how do we even judge quality? We'll discuss these issues, some potential ways to resolve them, and how we can become both better programmers as well as communicators.

## Asynchronous Awesome - Task Management in PHP

Talk by: Eric Mann

Description: Sometimes, our use of PHP grows beyond the typical request/response cycle of dynamic page generation. Unfortunately, the threaded nature of PHP - and the stateless nature of the server - betrays any efforts to expand our utilization of the server. Image processing, video rendering, APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) integration - any of these can easily take longer than is reasonable for a simple page request. Enter tools like message and job queues that empower daemonized PHP workers to handle data processing in the background. Yet further tools enable long-running event loops and asynchronous Promise-driven operations. PHP isn't multi-threaded, but that doesn't mean you're limited to a single-thread paradigm. I will demonstrate various use cases necessitating asynchronous operations, then delve into the code and the tools that make these systems work. Every attendee will leave armed with new ways to think about the management of large data jobs in PHP and an understanding of the tools they can use to make it happen.


## Option 1) Powering Your API Development with OpenAPI Version 3 

Talk by: Daniel Abernathy

Description: OpenAPI is more than just a documentation tool - even though it's great for that! As the tooling for OpenAPI version 3 has matured, there are now more opportunities to use OpenAPI to make your API development faster, easier, and more resilient. In this talk you'll learn how to use the OpenAPI spec and tools in the Open API ecosystem to power: - Mock servers to test your API before it exists - Integration tests to ensure that your API responses meet your specification - Validation logic - Documentation



## Option 2) Getting Your Head Around (Security) Headers 

Talk by: Elisa Towbis

Description: As developers, we spend most of our time focused on business logic, features, delivery dates and yes, bugs. I know I do. This session will focus on the web security and including the HTTP security headers that travel with each server Request and Response. Based on the best practices, as defined by organizations like OWASP, Mozilla and others, we'll explore the various headers that act as a line of defense against the craziness that's part of the world wide web. Expect lots of details and plenty of examples that will help us get our head around why the settings are important and what the suggested settings might be for your site and services. Topics covered will include HTTPS, Subresource Integrity (SRI), Cookies, Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and Cross-site security (XSS). We'll also explore tools like securityheaders.com and Mozilla Observatory.

## Eight (Peek into PHP 8)

Talk by: Sara Golemon

Description: It's hard to believe that it's been a mere four years since the release of PHP 7.0 which took a phenomenal leap forward in both performance and type safety. Now, with the release of 7.4 just weeks behind us, the work on PHP 8.0 is already well underway promising even better performance and an exciting array of new functionality to make writing applications in the web's favorite language easier, safer, and more robust. This session will explore what's new in PHP, why it matters to every website, and peek into the future as we start to explore what's great, about eight.
