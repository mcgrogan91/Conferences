## What does it mean to think like a programmer?

It's a mindset.

It's not about language skills, it's about learning how to think/learn

6 Concepts:

1. Be patient
 - Never going to know everything.  You're going to make mistakes
 - Hold onto a job that understands you'll make mistakes and learn
 - Need to have patience with ourselves, and continue to learn
 - Mistakes are how we grow
2. Master principals, not tools
 - We like to identify with our tools
 - Languages, tools, etc come and go
 - If you spend your time learning tools, you'll lose those skills when you eventually switch
 - Make sure you understand the _WHY_, and not just the _HOW_
3. See the wheels around you
 - Reinventing the wheel is important: It's why we have multiple programming languages/architectures/etc
 - Need to know what "wheels" you need.  What does the project need to optimize for, and what tools support that?
 - Sometimes nothing exists that fits, so you have to build it
 - "Broken wheels" - projects that fail. Important learning experiences
 - Check out package managers before you reinvent the wheel to see if one exists
4. Focus on Quality
 - It's okay to take your time.  It's okay to not ship code you're not confident in
 - Look up article this guy wrote - [Of Deadlines and Due Dates](https://blog.calevans.com/2006/02/03/of-deadlines-and-due-dates/)
 - Correct way to set deadlines - how long to write, test, QA, document
 - Once a deadline has been set, hit it
 - Programmers only tend to see the happy path. Edge cases will stop you in your tracks
 - The edge cases are what makes software development hard.  Mission critical pieces we have to pay attention to
5. Learn to Learn
 - Everything changes.  Languages, tools, best practices
 - Have to learn the current tech stack and stay current with it.  Also learning new tech coming down the pipe
 - Being able to learn isn't just important, it's vital
 - Most of us can read and understand the concept.  Need to be able to show in practice, apply concepts
 - This is why conferences are important. Developers will learn 12-15 new ideas on average
6. Find a Mentor
 - Somebody you can ask "Is this a good idea? Is there a better way I could approach this?"
 - Mentor is not a one way street, we all help each other
 - Pick a narrow question, send via email to some expert and thank them.
 - We don't get time back, so don't waste their time with easy questions

Developers are part artist, part scientist, full lifelong learner.
