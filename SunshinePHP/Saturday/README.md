# SunshinePHP 2020 - Friday

The second day of SunshinePHP, below are the talks I currently anticipate going to:

## Opening Keynote - Delivering Quality Software

Talk by: Josh Holmes

Description: To really deliver quality software is more than just slinging code. The code itself, while it represents the product itself, is a smaller percentage of what is required to truly ship quality software. In this discussion with Josh Holmes, we will explore ensuring that you're solving the right problem for the right customer in the right way.

## Environmental Variables

Talk by: Alena Holligan

Description: How do you handle the variables specific to the environment you use: Development, QA, Production, etc? Environmental Variables of course. But WHAT are they, WHY should you use them, WHERE do you put them, and HOW are they used. As an added bonus, Environmental Variables are not limited to PHP!

## Effective Redis for PHP Developers

Talk by: Matthew Turland

Description: Redis is a key-value store that has carved out a role for itself as a data structure server. If you're using it only for caching simple values, you're tapping a mere fraction of its power. This presentation provides an introduction to Redis and the Predis client library for it as well as related data structures that Redis supports and when it's best to use them. No computer science background is necessary; data structures are presented in understandable terms with practical examples.


## General Session - First, Write The Tests

Talk by: Bryce Embry 

Description: If your code has little or no test coverage, you're working too hard. While testing may seem like a lot of extra work, it's really a way to debug your code before you even write it, and to make sure it keeps working when you change it later on. In this session I'll share my journey from a "non-tester", to "pragmatic tester", and finally to "test-first developer". I'll explain how writing tests first forces you to write better code, then describe how to build an application-specific testing framework that makes writing tests easier, use sample data to write integration tests, and use mocks when you want to avoid complicated dependencies. In the end, you'll be ready to start working smarter by writing your tests first too.

## Xdebug 3.0

Talk by: Derick Rethans

Description: This talk is for developers who want to know how to debug their code in a better way, through single step debugging, profiling, and simpler debugging tools. Xdebug is a PHP extension that implements many debugging aids and features. In this presentation we are going to look at this new version of Xdebug 3. The new version is a near total rewrite, and brings many improvements over its older releases. You will learn how to optimally use the new features and settings to make your development life easier. Besides introducing the redone functionality, we will also have a cursory look at how these features are implemented, just to provide a better understanding of what a debugging extension, can, and cannot do. You will learn: - Which features Xdebug 3 has. - How to debug your application with a single step debugger. - How to make optimal use of the configuration options in Xdebug 3. - How some of the things in Xdebug work.


## The Fault In Our Code: Debugging Methods For Every Stage

Talk by: Camilo Payan

Description: Bugs happen, and when they do, developers need to be ready to remove those bugs. While debugging tools are important, without methodology they'll always be stabs in the dark. In this talk, we'll walk through debugging a program using repeatable methods. Starting with confirming your assumptions, we'll walk through the steps any developer can take to fix any bug.

## Stacking Up Middleware

Talk by: Mark Niebergall 

Description: The shift towards API driven design has echoed in new design patterns from traditional MVC. Middleware pipelines is geared to address the complexities and nuances that arise with APIs. We'll delve into Expressive, discuss strategies for adding layers, handling authentication and authorization, and implications for projects. Come learn all about middleware and discover how you can leverage pipelines in your development.

## Closing Keynote - Somebody's Gotta Do it

Talk by: Adam Culp

Description: N/A?
